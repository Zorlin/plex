        "Reliable comparison of model performance is an important component of machine learning research. Creating shared truths about model performance relies on 1) versioned and public benchmark data, 2) open, and highly reproducible evaluation metrics, as well as ideally 3) open, and accessible models. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we provide an example of how PLEX - an open source decentralised compute and storage platform - can enable highly reproducible model performance benchmarks. We compare two recently published machine learning based docking algorithms on the time-split PDBind data initially proposed by Stärk et al. We demonstrate reproducibility of previously published pose accuracy results and open up new ways for the wider community to run these models with custom inputs. \n",
